  <h3>Functionality Options</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <code>closeOnOutsideClick</code>: Default is <code>true</code>, which
      allows the user to click the dark overlay outside the modal window to
      close the modal.
    </li>
    <li>
      <code>closeOnEscape</code>: Default is <code>true</code>, which allows the
      user to hit the <code>escape</code> key on their keyboard to close the
      modal.
    </li>
    <li>
      <code>disableForeground</code>: If `true`, this causes the white box surrounding the
      modal content to be transparent, and switches the default text color from
      <code>black</code> to <code>white</code>. When combined with
      <code>closeOnOutsideClick: false</code> and
      <code>closeOnEscape: false</code>, this allows one to use the modal as an
      un-exitable overlay, such as a <code>loading state</code>. By default,
      setting this option to true also sets <code>disableNativeClose</code> to
      <code>true</code>, but <code>disableNativeClose</code> can be explicitly
      set back to <code>false</code> if you prefer.
    </li>
    <li>
      <code>disableAnimation</code>: If <code>true</code>, this disables a
      modal's opening/closing animations. This is useful for certain situations,
      such as when you are:
      <ul>
        <li>Using a modal as a loading state.</li>
        <li>
          Facing a modal that needs to programmatically open then close quickly.
          You should generally use the promises that are returned from
          <code>open</code> and <code>close</code>, but sometimes promises are
          more complex to use than is preferable. An example of this could be a
          modal that opens on one route, then closes on another.
        </li>
      </ul>
  </li>
    <li>
      <code>forService</code>: If <code>true</code>, the modal is registered
      with the <code>remodal</code> service in your application. You'll find
      more on using modals as a service in
      {{link-to 'using ember-remodal as a service' 'service'}}.
    </li>
  </ul>
